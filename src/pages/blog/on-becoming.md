How enjoyable can life be without its ups and downs—the battles of the mind and the challenges that test our perceptions of fear and what is unreal?

Over the past few months, I’ve been navigating new heights in my career. My internship has granted me the chance to delve into fascinating projects and deepen my knowledge.

Before starting my internship, I made it a point to apply the principles I learned—from books and from someone I admire.

I’m proud of how far I’ve come; it's been a significant journey. However, it hasn't come without sacrifices, like reducing time spent on social media, writing, and contributing to open source.

Amidst all this, a lingering thought persists: 'Should I pursue a second job or commit to indie hacking?' It's a peculiar dilemma. I had a keen interest in indie hacking before my internship, drawn to its culture. Yet, the demands of my 9-5 job have steered me away from it.

Finding balance has been a challenge—I knew it wouldn't be easy—to juggle learning, working, and pursuing indie projects. Despite this, my ingrained mindset to seek solutions has kept me motivated. I’ve brainstormed ideas, though I haven't acted on any yet.

This struggle has left me feeling somewhat discontented, as if I’m losing a cherished part of myself in pursuit of my goals. A podcast resonated deeply with me when the host shared, 'I became comfortable with my job before I started building.' It mirrored my own experience and emotions perfectly.

So, I write this article because I finally feel a sense of comfort in where I am now. The pressure I once felt has eased.

This doesn’t mean I won’t continue to give my best at my 9-5 job; rather, I’ll focus on effectiveness over mere productivity. There’s never a 'right time' to start, but delaying can only hold me back.

See you next time.
