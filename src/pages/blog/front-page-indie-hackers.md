During the days I spent without my laptop, I studied Tally forms, an online form builder. I read several articles and listened to interviews by the founders.

More on the days without my laptop [here](https://lennyaiko.hashnode.dev/the-rope-principle).

I looked through my notes again and again, learning more about some action steps and putting some of them into action. I decided to share some of my discoveries with anyone who is interested in learning from them.

I decided to write a summarized article on some of the lessons I have learned. I published the article on hashnode and [indiehackers.com](https://indiehackers.com).

I closed the webpage without thinking twice after publishing. Why? I've made some posts on the website with no response. So I made the decision to just keep posting anyway, which is what I did.

**8 days** after posting, I decided to read one or two of the platform's stories. I noticed my post on the first page while scrolling. I was astounded and instantly got a screenshot.

Oh yeah! The largest post is mine ðŸ™‚

I shared the screenshot on several social platform and decided to write briefly about it for memory sake. The [post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/8-lessons-i-learned-from-tally-f7c01233e8) can be found here.

Thanks for reading. See you on the next one.
