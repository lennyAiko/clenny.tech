After basking in the joy of my article making it to the front page of [indiehackers.com](https://indiehackers.com), just like Aaron Francis, I said to myself "I have achieved a big personal milestone what good thing could come next?".

3 days later after, I got up early to do some coding / study. I unlocked my device and saw I had more notifications than usual on X, I opened it to see me tagged in a post by [@IndieHackers](https://x.com/IndieHackers?s=20).

It felt like my joy has been renewed and I felt like I could do more for indie hacking community if my article could get this far.

Here's the link to the post: [click me!](https://x.com/IndieHackers/status/1722021610528415763?s=20) and a screenshot below:
