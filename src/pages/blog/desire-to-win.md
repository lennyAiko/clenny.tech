As simple as this sounds, it is also an important piece between performing at a level 5 and performing at a level 12.

Desire has been a major fuel for performance, how much you desire an outcome will always determine the amount of pressure or effort you put in.

Imagine a race car with no steering wheel, it would go so fast that it would crash because it is not being directed by the steering wheel. The same principle applies to a desire with no direction.

You have probably heard alot of folks - you might also fall in this category - who decides to do something because they have a desire for it but after a week or two they stop with enough excuses to justify their decision for stopping.

This sums up to the point that they had a desire but it had no direction, hence the reason for this article "Desire to win". This article is to give direction to the desires you may have now or that are to come in the nearest future.

Hold on! This is not rocket science or a philosophy class, these are simple steps for you to apply to what you are currently chasing after or will chase after. Let's get to it.

1. **Study your environment**.

Understanding how things work in your environment is a great place to start. This way you are able to know what target to set and if available, your competitors.

It is possible to also notice a thing or two in your environment that can either support or fuel your desire.

2. **Set your target to conquer**.

Now that you have a clear picture of your environment, you can set your target to conquer. This is what you want to do and how you want to do it.

Most of the time you may know your "want", but the "how" will not come immediately. In cases like that you may need to ponder more on what you want, and think about the most basic thing you can do to get started on chasing this desire.

3. **Conquer your target.**

You have studied your environment and set your target to conquer. Now it is time to conquer it. This is also the step that most people miss it and quit, you should condition your mind to finish now that you have given your desire a direction.

This phase will get boring sometimes but enjoy the boredom, it is part of the process of conquering your target. One may say there are more benefits and results from doing the boring stuff.

To "desire to win" goes beyond just wanting to make the outcome possible, it takes sacrifice. You will need to not negotiate the sacrifice you need to make to for your desired outcome to become a reality.
