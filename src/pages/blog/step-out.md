I love it when I see people set targets or aspire to achieve new things; When people are willing to step out of their comfort zones and take risks, I find it inspiring.

The concept "step out" may sound like a cliche, but it does not necessarily mean stepping out of your comfort zone.

What do I mean?

Some times, to make a change it does mean 'adding' a new vision or target. People seldom realize this. It is human nature for people to always prefer adding to themselves than subtracting from themselves.

People love addition but don't think about subtraction.

This brings us back to the concept of "step out". For example, to achieve a certain goal you might need to cultivate a new habit. However, that is not the only solution, also take a look at those habits that are holding you back that you do unconsciously.

Stopping old habits is a subtraction - probably a difficult one - but it is a step out. Those habits or way of thinking might be what you need to stop or change in order to achieve your target.

So when thinking of what to add to step out, think of what to subtract to step out.

See you on the next one.
