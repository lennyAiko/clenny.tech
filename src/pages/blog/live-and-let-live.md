One thing most people know how to do is to 'give'. Be it love, material possessions, care and what not. It feels really good to give out, to share, to put a smile on someone's face and to make someone joyous. For someone to feel happy that they know you and to feel responsible for the happiness of a loved one or a close person.

What many don't recognize is, sometimes we get so used to giving that we forget to receive; and when we do receive, we don't completely feel worth it or like we deserve it.

For years I have experienced and I always told myself that whatever gift I received I would work hard to be worth it cause I didn't feel like I deserved it or like I could receive something like that again.

It took me sometime to realize that everything I receive is because I deserved it, either from the seeds I have sown or from someone who wants to sow a seed. I no longer feel like I need to work so hard for good things to come to me.

You need to realize this also to set yourself free from the cage of 'not deserving what you receive'.

What the title - "Live and let live" - is saying to you is to give and let yourself receive. You can be a reason or a supporter of someone's happiness but being responsible for it is not something you should keep in mind.

Therefore:\
"If you love, let yourself be loved."\
"If you care, let yourself be cared for."\
"If you help, let yourself be helped."\
"If you lift someone, let yourself be lifted."\
"If you make someone happy, let yourself be made happy."\
"If you gift, let yourself be gifted."\
"If you amaze someone, let yourself be amazed."\
"If you congratulate, let yourself be congratulated."\
"If you give, let yourself receive."

This might look like a small step to take but once you get it right, you will begin to notice the good things right in front of you.

If this is of any help to you or someone you know, do me a kind favor by sharing. You can also reach out to me.
